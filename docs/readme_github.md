# 🚀 issue - branch - merge

As much as possible I want to use this approach 👍

From https://github.com/castorfou/lmelp, 🔗

- create an issue 📝
- from issue create merge request (this auto creates the branch) 🔀
- work from this branch 💻
- when satisfied merge to main (then github actions will trigger) ✅

# 🤖 github actions

configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` ⚙️
