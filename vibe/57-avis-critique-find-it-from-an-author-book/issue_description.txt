former implementation was to offer avis_critique from an episode
and it had 2 functions:

- to (re)generate a page of avis critique, in 2 parts ; LIVRES DISCUTÉS AU PROGRAMME and COUPS DE CŒUR DES CRITIQUES
- or load an existing page of avis critique

existing avis critique pages are stored in mongodb / avis_critique collection
one entry per episode

In this new feature,
I would like to offer a new access to avis_critique from a book

It would be a new page or subpage in streamlit
